### Project Description
Red flag radar is a web-based reflection tool that analyzes communication text and behavioral inputs to surface relationship interaction patterns. It helps users understand consistency and communication dynamics through structured, non-judgmental insights.

### The Problem statement
People often interpret relationship communication based on isolated messages or emotions, making it difficult to recognize broader interaction patterns and behavioral consistency. There is a lack of accessible tools that help individuals reflect on communication dynamics using multiple signals in a structured way.

### The Solution
SignalCheck provides a multi-signal reflection platform that combines message analysis with behavioral self-assessment to generate pattern-based insights. By synthesizing communication signals and behavioral indicators, the system encourages thoughtful reflection rather than single-message interpretation.

## Features

List the key features of your project:
- Users can paste conversation text to detect linguistic patterns such as deflection, invalidation, and guilt framing using rule-based analysis.
- Behavioral Reflection Quiz: A structured Likert-scale questionnaire captures observations across integrity, empathy, stability, and respect dimensions.
-Multi-Signal Pattern Insight: Combines communication signals and behavioral inputs to provide structured relationship pattern feedback rather than isolated interpretation.
-Privacy-First Client-Side Processing: All analysis occurs locally in the browser without accounts or server storage, ensuring user priva

#### Diagrams

**System Architecture:**

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture.png)
Red Flag Radar operates as a client-side Next.js application where user inputs from the text analyzer and behavioral quiz are processed locally using rule-based logic to generate pattern insights without server-side storage.

**Application Workflow:**

![Workflow](docs/workflow.png)
Users start from the landing page, submit communication text for analysis, complete the behavioral quiz, and receive synthesized pattern insights generated from combined signals.
